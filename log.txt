Suceeded in having the question display outside the label - I wasn't escaping into JSX with {}

added to to do list: have budget results display properly

did some research on how to make the labels display


1/8/22

tried to resolve the issue of non centering of the body element

tomorrow and tonight going to try to have the label display


1/9/22 

Figured out the issue with the label not being displayed - had an extra set of curly braces around the HTML element

Next issue is that labels can't be typed into, need to make sure they return numbers to the budget for final tabulation


1/10/22

Changed the welcome message prompts and thoughts about the proper way to display the question prompts.

devoted some thought to how to display finished budget - HTML tables looking appropriate. Possibly will need to make an extra class for them to work.

1/11/22

Designed budget return offline, started refactoring for the return message and additional class needed to display the completed budget

1/12/22

Added basic budget return file. Some refactoring still has to be done to get it to work - modification of the file's exports as well.
